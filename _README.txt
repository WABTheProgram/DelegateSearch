Well hello there, I see you've stumbled upon my app. In this USB you will find my creative piece, which is a Java based video game. 
Please look for the file labeled "IBMC.java" NOT "IBMC.class" and NOT "IBMC.html" or else your computer will brick. Ignore the images in the folder. 
Also please make sure you have "Ready to Program" installed or any java compiler equivalent, I've attached a downloadable version in this file. 
Also if your using a Mac you won't have the best experience. 
Sorry about the long process, Enjoy :)
